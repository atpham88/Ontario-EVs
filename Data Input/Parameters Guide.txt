SILVER Inputs:
	VRE Plants:
	Each wind/solar generator is provided with its accompanying information including capacity and MERRA data.  
	The MERRA data matches each resource to given hourly capacity factors for solar and wind in the Solar_Generation_data and Wind Generation_Data folders, respectively.  
	Non-VRE Parameters:
	These parameters provide performance characteristics and constraints for the different types of plants used in the SILVER models.
	Non-VRE Plants
	Each plant in the system is given.
	The operating cost for the plants are specified by a function in the Operating Cost ($/MWh) column.
	The 'Kind' of plant matches the plants with the parameters given on the Non-VRE Parameters sheet. 
Ontario Base Demand:
	Hourly demand data for Ontario without any additional EV demand.
EV Charging Scenarios
	Using a "Home" charging assumption, represents the additional demand from 5 different scenarios (each a different percent penetration) for each hour of the day.
hydro_daily budget
	For each hydro_daily plant referenced in SILVER Inputs, contains the generation budget for each day of a year.  
hydro_hourly capacity
	Contains the hourly generation data for each hydro_hourly plant in the SILVER Inputs spreadsheet.
importexport_hourly
	Fixed import/export data for each hour of the year.
